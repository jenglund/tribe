@chatgpt45firstresult.txt @chatgpto3firstdraft.txt @DRAFT-CLAUDE4-DESIGN.md @gemini25firstdraft.txt @prompt4chatgpt45.txt I've provided the prompt (prompt4chatgpt45.txt) which I originally gave to each of you (Claude 4 Sonnet), Gemini 2.5 Pro, ChatGPT 4.5, and ChatGPT o3, as well as the results from each of you (DRAFT-CLAUDE4-DESIGN.md, gemini25firstdraft.txt, chatgpt45firstresult.txt, chatgpto3firstdraft.txt respectively). Analyze all four of these plans, create a file called OPEN-QUESTIONS.md with a markdown-formatted checklist of any ambiguities, unclear specifications, unresolved questions, conflicts between the specifications (if at least 2 of you agree on how to do something, great, but if there's no agreement, we might need to work it out more!) and other things that we need to work out further in order to get into a state where we have the clear requirements and can formulate a testing and implementation plan. After that, create a file called `CLAUDE4-COMBINED-ANALYSIS.md` and in there put a markdown-formatted consolidation of all the plans, listing out the general union of all the points and ideas and specifications across all of the documents, reconciled to the most well-aligned-with-best-practices solution we have for that particular issue/challenge/problem/requirement, and reconciled to be internally-consistent across the entire combined document. Also, one question I can answer now is that I would like to use GraphQL where it's appropriate, as that's also another technology that Khan Academy uses, so it's beneficial for me to utilize it in this project and get experience with it too.
