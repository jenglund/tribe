## Known Issues & Future Work

### Known Technical Considerations
1. **Real-time Collaboration**: WebSocket implementation needed for smooth elimination rounds
2. **Location Services**: Consider PostGIS for advanced geographic queries
3. **Caching Strategy**: Redis for session data and frequently accessed lists
4. **Performance**: Database query optimization for complex filters
5. **Mobile Experience**: Progressive Web App features for mobile usage

### High Priority Future Work
- [ ] Advanced filtering options (price range, ratings, custom criteria)
- [ ] Email notification system for invites and decisions
- [ ] List import/export functionality
- [ ] Decision analytics and insights
- [ ] Mobile application development

### Medium Priority Future Work
