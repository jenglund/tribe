# Implementation Examples

This directory contains implementation examples for the Tribe application services. These are reference implementations extracted from the design documents to help developers understand the expected patterns and structure.

## Important Notes

- **These are examples, not final implementations** - Use as reference for understanding expected patterns
- **Type definitions** are found in the authoritative [DATA-MODEL.md](../DATA-MODEL.md#go-type-definitions)
- **Complete design details** are in the respective design documents:
  - [TRIBE-DESIGN.md](../TRIBE-DESIGN.md) - Tribe governance and management
  - [ACTIVITIES.md](../ACTIVITIES.md) - Activity tracking and logging
  - [DECISION-MAKING.md](../DECISION-MAKING.md) - Decision-making processes
  - [TESTING.md](../TESTING.md) - Testing strategies and examples

## File Structure

### Service Examples
- `tribe-governance-service.go` - Democratic tribe management, invitations, and voting
- `activity-service.go` - Activity tracking and logging for list items
- `filter-engine.go` - Advanced filtering engine for decision-making
- `decision-service.go` - K+M elimination algorithm implementation

### Testing Examples  
- `service-tests.go` - Unit and integration test patterns
- `test-helpers.go` - Common test utilities and fixtures

## Usage Guidelines

1. **Import Structure**: Adjust import paths to match your actual project structure
2. **Error Handling**: Implement proper error types for your application
3. **Database Layer**: Implement the `repository.Database` interface according to your data access patterns
4. **Type Safety**: Ensure all referenced types are properly imported from your models package
5. **Testing**: Follow the test-driven development patterns shown in the examples

## Cross-References

- **Database Schema**: [DATA-MODEL.md](../DATA-MODEL.md) - Complete database schema and type definitions
- **API Design**: [DATA-MODEL.md#api-design-hybrid-graphqlrest](../DATA-MODEL.md#api-design-hybrid-graphqlrest) - GraphQL schema and REST endpoints
- **Business Logic**: Individual design documents for detailed business rules and requirements

## Development Workflow

1. **Read the design document** for the feature you're implementing
2. **Review the corresponding example** in this directory for patterns
3. **Check type definitions** in DATA-MODEL.md for complete struct definitions
4. **Write tests first** following the TDD patterns shown
5. **Implement the service** using the example as a guide
6. **Update documentation** if you discover better patterns

**Note**: These examples use placeholder imports and simplified error handling. Adapt them to your actual project structure and error handling strategy.
