Let's begin by breaking down your detailed project vision into structured documents, beginning with a comprehensive and clear list of User Stories, then designing a high-level architecture and database schema tailored to your described requirements. I'll also highlight key questions and decisions you'll need to clarify for the best UX and technical implementation.

Step 1: User Stories
User Management
As a user, I can sign up/log in using Google OAuth.

As a user, I can sign up/log in via OTP sent to my email (low priority).

As a user, I can log out of my session.

As a user, I can delete (or soft-delete) my account.

As a user, I can view and update my profile information (name, profile picture, email).

Tribe Management
As a user, I can create a Tribe (group) of 1-8 users.

As a user, I can invite other users to my Tribe.

As a Tribe member, I can accept or decline invitations to join Tribes.

As a Tribe owner, I can remove members from my Tribe.

As a Tribe member, I can leave a Tribe.

As a Tribe member, I can delete (or soft-delete) my Tribe.

List Management
As a user, I can create a personal list with multiple entries (restaurants, movies, vacations).

As a user, I can edit, reorder, or remove items from my personal lists.

As a user, I can share my personal list with other users or Tribes.

As a user, I can stop sharing my personal lists.

As a Tribe member, I can create Tribe-owned lists.

As a Tribe member, I can collaboratively edit Tribe lists.

As a Tribe member, I can view all lists shared with the Tribe.

As a Tribe member, I can remove items from Tribe-owned lists.

As a user or Tribe member, I can soft-delete lists.

List Item Management
As a user, I can add list items with fields including:

Name (required)

Description (optional)

Category (optional)

Tags (optional, e.g., vegan, vegetarian, cuisine type)

Location/Address (optional, for filtering by proximity)

Opening hours (optional, for open-now or open-at filtering)

History of visits (timestamp, attendees, optional notes)

As a user, I can log visits or interactions with items, capturing date/time, attendees, and notes.

Decision-Making
As a user or Tribe, I can select multiple lists to combine into a decision-making session.

As a user or Tribe, I can set decision-making filters such as:

Cuisine type exclusions ("no Mexican")

Vegan/vegetarian options required

Distance constraints ("within 20 miles")

Open hours constraints ("open for next 90 minutes")

Visit history filters ("not visited in last X months")

As a user or Tribe, I can request a single random selection matching filters.

As a user or Tribe, I can initiate a KN+M selection:

Select number of initial items generated (KN+M algorithm)

Select how many each participant can eliminate (K)

Select how many final choices the system randomly picks from (M)

As a user, I receive clear visual and interactive prompts guiding me through the elimination process.

Syncing External Data (Future/low priority)
As a user, I can sync my "Want To Go" list from Google Maps.

As a user, I can manually refresh or revoke external sync connections.

Step 2: High-Level Architecture
Frontend
Tech Stack:

React with TypeScript

Axios for HTTP requests

React Query or SWR for data caching/state management

Tailwind CSS or similar for UI styling

Shadcn/ui or similar component library for consistent UI components

Structure:

Authentication handling

Tribe and List management UIs

Decision-making workflows and interactive elimination views

Real-time feedback on data validation and filter states

Backend
Tech Stack:

Go (Gin or Echo framework)

JWT for authentication

PostgreSQL as a database

Docker containers for easy local hosting

Structure:

RESTful API endpoints for:

Authentication (OAuth, email OTP)

Tribe CRUD operations

User CRUD operations

List and list items CRUD operations

Decision-making logic endpoints

Sync integration endpoints (low-priority/future)

Middleware for authentication, error handling, logging

Transaction management for data integrity

Step 3: Database Schema
Users

id (UUID, PK)

google_id (string, optional)

email (string, unique)

name (string)

profile_image_url (string)

created_at, updated_at, deleted_at

Tribes

id (UUID, PK)

name (string)

owner_id (UUID, FK Users)

created_at, updated_at, deleted_at

TribeMembers

tribe_id (UUID, FK Tribes)

user_id (UUID, FK Users)

role (string: "owner", "member")

joined_at

Lists

id (UUID, PK)

owner_user_id (UUID, FK Users, nullable)

owner_tribe_id (UUID, FK Tribes, nullable)

name (string)

description (string)

is_shared (bool)

created_at, updated_at, deleted_at

ListShares

id (UUID, PK)

list_id (UUID, FK Lists)

shared_with_user_id (UUID, nullable)

shared_with_tribe_id (UUID, nullable)

shared_at

ListItems

id (UUID, PK)

list_id (UUID, FK Lists)

name (string)

description (string)

category (string)

tags (string[])

location (geopoint/address)

opening_hours (JSON or structured)

created_at, updated_at, deleted_at

VisitHistory

id (UUID, PK)

item_id (UUID, FK ListItems)

visited_at (timestamp)

notes (string)

attendee_ids (UUID[])

Step 4: Technical and UX Decisions to Address
Technical
Confirm soft-deletion vs. hard-deletion policy clearly.

Decide on the granularity of the location data (structured address vs. lat/lon).

Decide whether to support real-time updates (websockets/polling).

UX
Clearly define how users interact with decision-making UX:

What does elimination UI look like?

What feedback is provided when criteria yield no results?

Define the interaction model clearly for list sharing:

Explicit acceptances required for sharing?

Accessibility considerations (color contrasts, ARIA labels, keyboard nav).

Step 5: Testing Plan
Backend API unit tests for CRUD operations.

Integration tests for decision-making algorithm correctness.

Error-handling tests (invalid data, access control).

Frontend UI tests for key flows (login, list creation, decision-making workflow).

E2E tests (Cypress/Playwright) for critical paths (sign up, Tribe setup, making decisions).

Step 6: Additional Considerations
CI/CD setup (GitHub Actions) for automated testing and deployments.

Containerization (Docker) for easy local setup.

Clear, comprehensive documentation for setup, contributing, and running with AI-agents (e.g., GitHub README, CONTRIBUTING.md).

Next Steps:
Confirm/correct the schema and user stories.

Prioritize MVP features for early implementation.

Establish a basic UI/UX mockup and API contract to guide implementation.

Write comprehensive docs guiding AI agents on contributions clearly.
