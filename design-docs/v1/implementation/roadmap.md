## Development Environment Setup

### Prerequisites
```bash
# Required software
- Go 1.21+
- Node.js 18+
- PostgreSQL 15+
- Docker & Docker Compose
- Git
```

### Initial Setup
```bash
# 1. Clone and setup backend
git clone <repo-url> tribe
cd tribe/backend
go mod tidy
docker-compose up -d postgres
go run cmd/migrate/main.go up

# 2. Setup frontend
cd ../frontend
npm install
npm run dev

# 3. Run tests
cd ../backend && go test ./...
cd ../frontend && npm test
```

### Development Workflow
1. **Daily Standup**: Review progress, blockers, and day's goals
2. **Feature Branches**: Each user story gets its own branch
3. **Code Review**: All code must pass review before merge
4. **Testing**: Tests must pass and coverage maintained
5. **Demo**: End of each week demo to stakeholders

## Quality Gates

### Week-End Reviews
Each week ends with:
- [ ] All planned user stories completed
- [ ] Tests passing with required coverage
- [ ] Code review approval
- [ ] Demo to stakeholders
- [ ] Documentation updated

### Phase-End Reviews
Each phase ends with:
- [ ] All phase objectives met
- [ ] Performance benchmarks passed
- [ ] Security review completed
- [ ] Deployment successful to staging
- [ ] User acceptance testing passed

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **Complex filtering logic**: Start with simple filters, iterate
- **Real-time synchronization**: Use proven WebSocket libraries
- **Database performance**: Index optimization and query monitoring
- **Mobile performance**: Progressive loading and optimization

### Timeline Risks
- **Scope creep**: Strict adherence to defined user stories
- **Technical debt**: Allocate 20% time for refactoring
- **External dependencies**: Minimize and have fallback plans
- **Team capacity**: Buffer time in each phase

## Success Metrics

### Technical Metrics
- 90% backend test coverage
- 85% frontend test coverage
- <200ms API response times
- <3 second page load times
- 99.9% uptime in production

### User Experience Metrics
- <30 seconds to create first tribe
- <2 minutes to complete first decision
- <5 clicks to add list item
