# Tribe App - Design Documentation v1

**Version:** v1.0  
**Date:** January 2025  
**Status:** Implementation Ready

## Overview

Tribe is a collaborative decision-making web application designed to help small groups (1-8 people) make choices about activities, restaurants, entertainment, and shared experiences through structured list management and algorithmic decision processes.

## Core Values

- **Simplicity**: Easy onboarding and intuitive user experience
- **Collaboration**: Designed for group decision-making without friction
- **Flexibility**: Adaptable to various decision types (restaurants, activities, entertainment)
- **Privacy**: Self-hostable, open-source with user data control
- **Small Scale**: Optimized for personal/friend groups, not enterprise scale
- **Reliability**: Robust error handling and graceful degradation

## Document Structure

This design is organized into focused documents that align with development workflow:

### Core Technical Documentation
- **[Architecture](./architecture.md)** - System architecture, technology stack, and high-level design
- **[Database Schema](./database-schema.md)** - Complete database design with all tables, relationships, and indexes
- **[API Design](./api-design.md)** - GraphQL schema and REST endpoints
- **[Authentication](./authentication.md)** - OAuth, JWT, and authorization systems

### Feature Documentation
- **[User Stories](./user-stories/)** - Complete user stories organized by domain:
  - [Authentication & Users](./user-stories/authentication.md)
  - [Tribe Management](./user-stories/tribes.md)
  - [List Management](./user-stories/lists.md)
  - [Decision Making](./user-stories/decisions.md)
  - [Activity Tracking](./user-stories/activity-tracking.md)

### Algorithm & Business Logic
- **[Decision Making Algorithm](./algorithms/decision-making.md)** - KN+M algorithm, elimination process, and quick-skip
- **[Filtering System](./algorithms/filtering.md)** - Advanced filter engine with priority system
- **[Governance System](./governance.md)** - Democratic tribe governance and conflict resolution

### Implementation Guidance
- **[Implementation Roadmap](./implementation/roadmap.md)** - 16-week development plan with milestones
- **[Testing Strategy](./implementation/testing-strategy.md)** - Testing approach, coverage goals, and examples
- **[Development Guidelines](./implementation/development-guidelines.md)** - Code quality, patterns, and AI collaboration

### Future Planning
- **[Known Issues & Future Work](./future-work.md)** - Technical debt, enhancements, and roadmap

## Quick Reference

**For Backend Development:**
- Start with [Database Schema](./database-schema.md) and [Architecture](./architecture.md)
- Reference [API Design](./api-design.md) for endpoints
- See [Authentication](./authentication.md) for auth implementation

**For Frontend Development:**
- Review [API Design](./api-design.md) for GraphQL schema
- Check [User Stories](./user-stories/) for UI requirements
- Reference [Architecture](./architecture.md) for frontend structure

**For Feature Implementation:**
- Find relevant user stories in [User Stories](./user-stories/)
- Check algorithms in [Algorithm Documentation](./algorithms/)
- Follow [Implementation Roadmap](./implementation/roadmap.md) phases

**For Testing:**
- See [Testing Strategy](./implementation/testing-strategy.md)
- Follow [Development Guidelines](./implementation/development-guidelines.md)

## Development Phases

1. **Phase 1 (Weeks 1-4):** Foundation - Auth, users, basic tribes
2. **Phase 2 (Weeks 5-8):** List management and sharing
3. **Phase 3 (Weeks 9-12):** Decision making and algorithms
4. **Phase 4 (Weeks 13-16):** Polish and production deployment

## Getting Started

1. Review [Architecture](./architecture.md) for technology choices
2. Set up development environment per [Implementation Roadmap](./implementation/roadmap.md)
3. Start with [Database Schema](./database-schema.md) setup
4. Follow [Authentication](./authentication.md) for first feature
5. Reference [User Stories](./user-stories/) for each feature sprint
